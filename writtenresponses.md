**\*Find the disproportionate rate relative to developed regions**

**3\. Existing Alternatives:** How is this problem solved today? Consider other products in the market\.

40 &#x2F; 40 words

Share what your target audience does today to address this problem\. Where is the \#1 place they turn? The existing alternatives may indirectly compete with your planned solution\.

**Modern intraoral devices like the 3Shape TRIOS and the VELscope System can detect periodontal disease and oral cavity cancers respectively, but cost thousands of dollars\. Instead, low\-income communities often have to rely on ineffective visual examinations to diagnose these conditions\.**

**4\. Solution:** What are the key characteristics of your innovation?

38 &#x2F; 40 words

Provide details about how your innovation meets the needs of your customers\. Focus on what’s unique about your process, assembly, or technology\.

**OralVision utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify common symptoms of oral cancers and periodontal diseases\. Unlike competitors, OralVision non\-invasively scans the patient&#39;s oral cavity using specialized cameras that account for distortion, providing physicians with an accurate potential diagnosis\.**

**\*\*\*Potential accurate diagnosis, not accurate potential diagnosis\.**

**5\. Unique Value Proposition:** What makes your innovation different from what’s already in the market?

38 &#x2F; 40 words

Your unique value proposition should communicate why your innovation is better than all the others out there\. Why would your target market choose your innovation instead of the existing alternatives?

**Unlike market alternatives, OralVision utilizes advanced machine learning to analyze intraoral photos and provide a detailed assessment of possible patient conditions\. Furthermore, our innovation is significantly more affordable than conventional devices, making it more accessible to underprivileged communities\.**

**6\. Sustainable Advantage:** Why will it be difficult for others to copy you?

34 &#x2F; 40 words

Sustained success requires you to not only start with differentiation, but also to maintain it\. Include some details on what you can do to keep the distance between you and the other players in the market\.

**With a minimalist yet versatile design, our product will remain cheaper and easier to use than alternatives\. Additionally, we will continuously improve our machine learning algorithm through clinical partnerships where physicians provide HIPAA\-compliant training data\.**

**7\. Customer Segments:** Who is the target audience who is served by your innovation? Describe them\.

39 &#x2F; 40 words

Who is the target audience for your innovation? What are the demographics, what are their interests, and what makes them a single market?

**Physicians in low\-income communities are our target audience\. They generally lack the monetary resources required to purchase expensive intraoral diagnostic equipment for their clinics, resulting in frequent faulty diagnoses that undermine healthcare systems in these underserved communities\.** 

**8\. Early Adopters:** Who will be your very first customers? Describe them\.

37 &#x2F; 40 words

Within your target customer segment, who are the very first customers you will target? For example, you may target specific geography or a social group you have a preexisting connection to\.

**Our first testers will be local medical professionals, who will provide constructive feedback on our product\. Then, we will expand our customer base to clinics in underserved communities across the nation to streamline logistics and ultimately spread worldwide\.**

**9\. Channels:** How will you sell your innovation to your customers? How will you deliver it?

0 &#x2F; 40 words

Think through how you are going to attract the market to your innovation\. You’ll also need to deliver it to your customers\. How will you do that? Will you rely on partners? Will you use the internet? Look into how your competitors accomplish this today\.

**We aim to attract a market for OralVision by reaching out to established healthcare organizations like the Health Innovation Alliance for marketing support\. Then, we plan to use Amazon&#39;s FBA program for domestic distribution and Cencora WorldCourier for international logistics\.**

**10\. Key Metrics:** What are the most important numbers that track your success?

31 &#x2F; 40 words

Think through the most important 2\-3 metrics that you will use to measure your success\. Often, these correlate linearly with your success\. Key metrics could include financial measures and measures of impact or adoption\.

**We hope that 10% of physicians in low\-income communities in the US and 2\.5% internationally adopt OralVision by 2030\. In addition, we aspire to reach a cumulative revenue of $5,000,000 by the end of that year\.**

**\*\*Perform estimation exercise to find metrics**

**11\. Cost Structure:** What are your most significant costs?

35 &#x2F; 40 words

Think in terms of your recurring variable costs\. No need to list everything here: focus on the main drivers\. What are the ongoing costs to produce and deliver your innovation?

**Our most significant product costs include specialized cameras and processors for the device\. Additionally, some notable non\-manufacturing costs include marketing to physicians, especially in our inaugural year, and shipping to remote communities across the globe\.**

**12\. Revenue Streams:** How will you make money to fund your operations on an ongoing basis?

38 &#x2F; 40 words

How will you make money on an ongoing basis to invest back into your innovation? Consider sales, grants, donations, and other streams of cash to your team\. Make sure you focus on ongoing revenue from operations and not the upfront funds you’ll need to raise to start\.

**We aim to acquire capital for OralVision by establishing a high profit margin initially, as we recognize the low turnover biomedical device startups have\. Additionally, we will obtain sponsorships from corporations and NGOs in the medical and technology sectors\.**

# Elevator Pitch
Here's the elevator pitch: Oral cavity cancers are highly treatable when caught early, but almost 70% of cases are diagnosed too late due to clinical uncertainty and a lack of accessible screening tools, leading to over 170,000 deaths annually. OralVision is an intraoral, deep-learning-powered diagnostic device designed to change this unfortunate reality. The device captures high resolution images of the oral cavity and analyzes them in real time using a pre-trained neural network that can identify malignant tissue patterns oblivious to the naked eye. By integrating noninvasive imaging with advanced artificial intelligence, our innovation is capable of providing physicians with highly accurate diagnostic insights, allowing for earlier clinical referrals and therapeutic intervention. Moreover, with its use of inexpensive, yet powerful components, OralVision has the potential to be mass produced and distributed at a much lower marginal cost than existing solutions, ultimately contributing to improved 5 year survival rates, especially in marginalized low-income communities.

Due to personal limitations we can't test the device in a medical setting. However, we unit tested all points of failure and determined that our device properly converts image warps, transforms images, and our model works with high accuracy -->
