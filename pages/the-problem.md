## Customer Need

Underprivileged communities around the world suffer from disproportionately high rates of oral cavity cancers and periodontal diseases, often lacking the expensive medical screening technology required to diagnose these potentially dangerous, but highly-treatable conditions.

## Existing Alternatives

Modern intraoral devices like the 3Shape TRIOS and the VELscope System can detect periodontal disease and oral cavity cancers respectively, but cost thousands of dollars. Instead, low-income communities often have to rely on ineffective visual examinations to diagnose these conditions.

Physicians in low-income communities are our target audience. They generally lack the monetary resources required to purchase expensive intraoral diagnostic equipment for their clinics, resulting in frequent faulty diagnoses that undermine healthcare systems in these underserved communities.
