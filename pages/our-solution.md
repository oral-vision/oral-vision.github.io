## Key Characteristics

OralVision utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify common symptoms of oral cancers and periodontal diseases. Unlike competitors, OralVision non-invasively scans the patient's oral cavity using specialized cameras that account for distortion, providing physicians with an accurate potential diagnosis.

## Unique Value Proposition

Unlike market alternatives, OralVision utilizes advanced machine learning to analyze intraoral photos and provide a detailed assessment of possible patient conditions. Furthermore, our innovation is significantly more affordable than conventional devices, making it more accessible to underprivileged communities.
