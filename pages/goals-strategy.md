## Channels

We aim to attract a market for OralVision by reaching out to established healthcare organizations like the Health Innovation Alliance for marketing support. Then, we plan to use Amazon's FBA program for domestic distribution and Cencora WorldCourier for international logistics.

## Key Metrics

We hope that 10% of physicians in low-income communities in the US and 2.5% internationally adopt OralVision by 2030. In addition, we aspire to reach a cumulative revenue of $5,000,000 by the end of that year.

## Cost Structure

Our most significant product costs include specialized cameras and processors for the device. Additionally, some notable non-manufacturing costs include marketing to physicians, especially in our inaugural year, and shipping to remote communities across the globe.

## Revenue Streams

We aim to acquire capital for OralVision by establishing a high profit margin initially, as we recognize the low turnover biomedical device startups have. Additionally, we will obtain sponsorships from corporations and NGOs in the medical and technology sectors.
