Lean Canvas Questions

1. High-Level Concept  
OralVision utilizes machine learning to revolutionize oral diagnostics in underserved communities.  
*Note: Machine Learning → deep learning*

2. Problem  
Underprivileged communities around the world suffer from disproportionately high rates of oral cavity cancers and periodontal diseases, often lacking the expensive medical screening technology required to diagnose these potentially dangerous, but highly-treatable conditions.  
*Find the disproportionate rate relative to developed regions*

3. Existing Alternatives  
Modern intraoral devices like the 3Shape TRIOS and the VELscope System can detect periodontal disease and oral cavity cancers respectively, but cost thousands of dollars. Instead, low-income communities often have to rely on ineffective visual examinations to diagnose these conditions.

4. Solution  
OralVision utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify common symptoms of oral cancers and periodontal diseases. Unlike competitors, OralVision non-invasively scans the patient's oral cavity using specialized cameras that account for distortion, providing physicians with an accurate potential diagnosis.  
***Potential accurate diagnosis, not accurate potential diagnosis.***

5. Unique Value Proposition  
Unlike market alternatives, OralVision utilizes advanced machine learning to analyze intraoral photos and provide a detailed assessment of possible patient conditions. Furthermore, our innovation is significantly more affordable than conventional devices, making it more accessible to underprivileged communities.

6. Sustainable Advantage  
With a minimalist yet versatile design, our product will remain cheaper and easier to use than alternatives. Additionally, we will continuously improve our machine learning algorithm through clinical partnerships where physicians provide HIPAA-compliant training data.

7. Customer Segments  
Physicians in low-income communities are our target audience. They generally lack the monetary resources required to purchase expensive intraoral diagnostic equipment for their clinics, resulting in frequent faulty diagnoses that undermine healthcare systems in these underserved communities.

8. Early Adopters  
Our first testers will be local medical professionals, who will provide constructive feedback on our product. Then, we will expand our customer base to clinics in underserved communities across the nation to streamline logistics and ultimately spread worldwide.

9. Channels  
We aim to attract a market for OralVision by reaching out to established healthcare organizations like the Health Innovation Alliance for marketing support. Then, we plan to use Amazon's FBA program for domestic distribution and Cencora WorldCourier for international logistics.

10. Key Metrics  
We hope that 10% of physicians in low-income communities in the US and 2.5% internationally adopt OralVision by 2030. In addition, we aspire to reach a cumulative revenue of $5,000,000 by the end of that year.

11. Cost Structure  
Our most significant product costs include specialized cameras and processors for the device. Additionally, some notable non-manufacturing costs include marketing to physicians, especially in our inaugural year, and shipping to remote communities across the globe.

12. Revenue Streams  
We aim to acquire capital for OralVision by establishing a high profit margin initially, as we recognize the low turnover biomedical device startups have. Additionally, we will obtain sponsorships from corporations and NGOs in the medical and technology sectors.
